# EventTools
SCP:SL plugin designed to automate several tasks usually done by hand while organizing events.
This plugin is property of Miki_hero, using it is obviously allowed, if you wish to expand it, incorporate it into your project or use parts of it in any way feel free to do so but do give me credit for my work.

**Commands:**  
- **EventStart** - Starts the event by: removing all the items and ragdolls, enabling roundlock, setting respawn tickets to 1, forceclassing everyone to class d, forceclassing the command sender to tutorial and enabling noclip for them, locking all the doors in the facility. Useful for preparing the event.  
- **EventEnd** - Teleports everyone to Gate A and sets off fireworks! (they are a bit loud tho, so be careful whilst using). A fun way to end an event.  
- **EventCountdown** - sets off a silent cassie that counts down slowly from 10 to 1. Useful for starting the event.  
- **LockZone** - Toggles door lock in a specified zone (lcz/hcz/ez/surface/all), if the door was opened then it will be closed too. Useful for preparing the event.   
  
**Other Features:**  
- Whenever roundlock is toggled an adminchat message is sent.  
  
**Pretty much everything you can imagine about the above commands and features can be changed in the config file of your server.**
